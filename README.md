# Image Processor

Our two-person team was tasked with designing a project that utilized the processor we constructed throughout the semester as well as other peripheral technologies to come up with a creative product. Given the resources we were provided, we sought to implement an image processing device that integrated our processor, the FPGA board, the VGA screen, an Arduino microcontroller, a camera, and external software to facilitate inter-device communication. The details below describe how we planned it, what obstacles we faced, what solutions we found, how we finalized our ideas, and how we tested the product to ultimately ensure success of its design. Furthermore, we will discuss what improvements we would like to make and how we would change the device if provided more time on the project.
